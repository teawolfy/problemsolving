Venmo Term Project

The goal of this term project is to create an app that uses image analysis and communicates with the Venmo API to make bill splitting easier.
The app will take a picture of an itemized receipt, and use the Tesseract module to identify the line items and their cost.
The app will then allow the user to select any/all items, and send a Venmo payment request to a friend for the total cost.
